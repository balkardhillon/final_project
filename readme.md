I have made a Maths QUIZ app.

I used get_ques() function for getting the values from the array using the keys.
- Added conditions in makenextquestionready() function (i) if no answer is selected it will show an alert box
								(ii) else it will go to next question
-I also used the conditions to display the results.
-a timer, by using this I set the time for quiz to 60 seconds after 60 seconds it will automatically stops the test.
